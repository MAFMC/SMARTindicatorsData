## Indicator category


TESTING!!! This is a workflow test


## Indicator name

`r paste(indicator_name)`

Includes variable(s): `r paste(indicator_varname)`

## Indicator brief description


This indicator will tell me whether my code works if I can get it to make an Rmd from here.


## Indicator visualization


Testing always reveals useful patterns like major mistakes.

## Indicator documentation

### Are indicators available for others to use (data downloadable)?


Yes


#### Where can indicators be found?


Test data are everywhere, here is a link: https://testlink.org/ 


#### How often are they updated? Are future updates likely?


I plan to continue testing until stuff works! I break things often so workflow test updates are highly likely.  


#### Who is the contact?


Me! sgaichas@hydrascientificllc.com 


### Gather indicator statistics

#### Units


Unknwon


#### Length of time series, start and end date, periodicity


Testing is on the scale of hours and is done whenever there is a change.


#### Spatial location, scale and extent


Unknown.


#### Management scale: all species, FMP level, species level, can it be aggregated or separated to different scales?


Project Scale!


#### Uncertainty metrics


No.


### Are methods clearly documented to obtain source data and calculate indicators?


Yes. See https://github.com/MAFMC/SMARTindicatorsData 


#### Can the indicator be calculated from current documentation?


Yes.


#### Is code publicly available? up to date?


Yes. see github repo above. Just updated here: https://github.com/MAFMC/SMARTindicatorsData/blob/main/R/create_template_generic.R and here: https://github.com/MAFMC/SMARTindicatorsData/blob/main/templates/SMART_template_generic.rmd .


#### Have methods changed over time?


I modified methods in ECSA and will keep modifying them till this works.


### Are indicator underlying source data linked or easy to find?


No, I’m making this up.


#### Where are source data stored?


Unknown.


#### How/by whom are source data updated? Are future updates likely?

### Are the indicators sensitive to a small change in the process, or what is the threshold of change that is detectable?


Yes, this workflow is likely sensitive to small changes in the code. Will find out.


### Is there a time lag between the process change and the indicator change? How long?


Unknown.



## Comments

### Additional potential links to management in addition to uses listed above


Exact keyword



### What additional work would be needed for the Council to use the indicator? 


Way more documentation of how to use this, assuming I get it to work in the first place



### What issues are caused if there is a gap or delay in data underlying the indicator


The SMART catalog won’t be updated.
