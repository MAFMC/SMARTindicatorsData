This is a workflow test 2 Indicator name Includes variable(s): 3 Indicator brief description This indicator will tell me whether my code works if I can get it to make an Rmd from here. 4 Indicator visualization Testing always reveals useful patterns like major mistakes. 5 Indicator documentation 5.1 Are indicators available for others to use (data downloadable)? Yes 5.1.1 Where can indicators be found? Test data are everywhere, here is a link: https://testlink.org/ 5.1.2 How often are they updated? Are future updates likely? I plan to continue testing until stuff works! I break things often so workflow test updates are highly likely. 5.1.3 Who is the contact? Me! sgaichas@hydrascientificllc.com 5.2 Gather indicator statistics 5.2.1 Units Unknwon 5.2.2 Length of time series, start and end date, periodicity Testing is on the scale of hours and is done whenever there is a change. 5.2.3 Spatial location, scale and extent Unknown. 5.2.4 Management scale: all species, FMP level, species level, can it be aggregated or separated to different scales? Project Scale! 5.2.5 Uncertainty metrics No. 5.3 Are methods clearly documented to obtain source data and calculate indicators? Yes. See https://github.com/MAFMC/SMARTindicatorsData 5.3.1 Can the indicator be calculated from current documentation? Yes. 5.3.2 Is code publicly available? up to date? Yes. see github repo above. Just updated here: https://github.com/MAFMC/SMARTindicatorsData/blob/main/R/create_template_generic.R and here: https://github.com/MAFMC/SMARTindicatorsData/blob/main/templates/SMART_template_generic.rmd . 5.3.3 Have methods changed over time? I modified methods in ECSA and will keep modifying them till this works. 5.4 Are indicator underlying source data linked or easy to find? No, I’m making this up. 5.4.1 Where are source data stored? Unknown. 5.4.2 How/by whom are source data updated? Are future updates likely? 5.5 Are the indicators sensitive to a small change in the process, or what is the threshold of change that is detectable? Yes, this workflow is likely sensitive to small changes in the code. Will find out. 5.6 Is there a time lag between the process change and the indicator change? How long? Unknown. 6 Comments 6.1 Additional potential links to management in addition to uses listed above Exact keyword 6.2 What additional work would be needed for the Council to use the indicator? Way more documentation of how to use this, assuming I get it to work in the first place 6.3 What issues are caused if there is a gap or delay in data underlying the indicator The SMART catalog won’t be updated.
